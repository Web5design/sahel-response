description: This map shows the current vegetation growth deviations for the 2011 season by second-level administrative divisions. Information has been extracted from MODIS NDVI time-series (2000-2010), only considering the first (or main) growing season for considered years and using the Seasonal Small Integral parameter in order to describe vegetation productivity. Pixel based results are proposed (0.05 degrees). Results here are summarized using second-level administrative boundaries. Further information can be found on the [ITHACA website](http://www.ithacaweb.org/maps/).
