description: This map summarizes the number of vegetation growing seasons affected by poor vegetation growth between 2006 and 2010, supporting the definition of the most vulnerable areas. Information has been extracted from MODIS NDVI time-series (2000-2010), only considering the first (or main) growing season for considered years and using the Seasonal Small Integral parameter in order to describe vegetation productivity. Pixel based results are proposed (0.05 degrees). Further information can be found on the [ITHACA website](http://www.ithacaweb.org/maps/).
